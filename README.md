i program things sometimes
only competent in python and binary for my own arch (pee shit butt architecture (only exists in minecraft))
i made a simple cpu in minecraft with a theoretical 1hz clock speed if i could get the rom to wake the fuck up and the alu to also wake the fuck up. it has 21 lines of 
rom because i got bored of building more which also means that the rom is the only 5 bit thing on the damn machine. it has 16 bytes of ram although it will never use half of it and there is no cache (i use the rom bus to read from ram addresses becasue fuck you i do what i want). 
It has run the fib sequence up to 128 where it then prompltly shits its pants and start writing junk data to ram. Will be re building it and using an instnat crry adder to shorten alu response time from like 12 ticks to 4 ticks and will be stealing an instant decoder design from the ram to use as the stepper for the rom 
oh i also made a "calculator" in minecraft and you can manually multiply and divide by literally piping the registers directly into input b. 
currently learning javascript,css,html5, and a little bit of php so that i can fuck ur mom
and uh yeah
im pretty cool....
